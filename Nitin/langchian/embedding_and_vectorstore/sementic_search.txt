Vector Database & Semantic Search Notes

Embedding Models
-> Embedding models convert the source (text, images, video) to vectors without losing their semantic meaning

Vector Similarity Measurement
-> Euclidean distance is used to measure similarity between vectors in a vector space
-> The shorter the distance, the more the similarity

Performance Optimization with ANN
-> To improve the performance of the search, we can use ANN (Approximate Nearest Neighbor)
-- In ANN: performance increases, accuracy decreases


HNSW Algorithm
-> HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) is a type of ANN
-- In HNSW: vectors are arranged in graphs where the bottom nodes contain all the vectors

Analogy: To find a house, first find the city (top node), then neighborhood, then the street, then the house (bottom node)
